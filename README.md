# iPhilly
A visually impaired user will verbally tell the AI model in this website a tourist place in Philly, The AI model will search for this place, find images and reviews. AI will analyze these images and generate text that helps the user gain a mental image of the place.

## Inspiration
Imagine being visually impaired (my partner and I don't have to imagine) and being dropped right in the center of a popular tourist spot. This leaves you vulnerable and scared.
Our website is an accessibility accommodation, for those with visual imparities to be able to mental visualize a place they want to visit in Philly before they actually go to it. This will prepare them, and they will be able to go around confident and fully knowing what to expect.

## What it does
iPhilly helps people with visual impairments learn about popular places in Philadelphia. We provide descriptions that allow them to "see" the place in their mind before visiting. This way, they feel more prepared and comfortable exploring on their own.

## How we built it
HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the website layout.
SerpApi for information about places in Philadelphia.
Voiceflow AI Agent features to search and read descriptions aloud.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of: 
Accessible Design: We added voice features to help users with visual impairments.
User-Friendly: The design is simple, making it easy for users to find and understand information.
Real-Time Information: We used SerpApi to get accurate, up-to-date data about places in Philly.

## Challenges we ran into
As beginners, finding the right tools to build the AI model was very hard and took up most of our time. Research played the largest role in our project. We had to find the perfect APIs (free while at it) and then learn how to integrate it into our model.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
The Importance of Accessibility: We learned how important it is to make things accessible for everyone.
Using APIs: We learned how to work with external data and integrate it into the website.
